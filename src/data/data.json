        "paragraph": "It all started as a thirst for a cup of some kasi brew coffee with a side of Vetkoes, all served in a world class service to a first class customer. Today Jays is not just filling up disposable coffee mugs but also the stomachs of entrepreneurs and innovators with mouth watering dishes and freshly baked pastry.",
        "plong": "Jays is more than just the right place to be when hungry or on the go and in need for a cup of coffee. Jays is a way of life. An intersection between people who are hungry for success and food that molds, refreshes, and rejuvenates the soul. A refill station for the spirits of thrivers and conquerors. A place where you can take home more than just take away but it is a home where you can get soul food meant for your home. We bake, cook, fry and serve with love and appreciation."
